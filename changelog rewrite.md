## Broad Cleanup
- Sorted enchants into groups
- Moved maxlvl, treasure, enabled, enchantabilities into configs
- Moved isOffensivePetDisallowed to isDamageSourceAllowed
- Added canApply override to EnchantmentCurse to properly disallow curses on e-table without disabling them on anvil
- Added EnumSlots to move checked slots (getMaxEnchantmentLevel and getEnchantedItem) to EnchantRegistry
- Renamed EnumList to EnumTypes (additional types of items this enchant can go on, vanilla got EnumEnchantmentType)
- Merged calcDamageForNegativeSwipe and calcDamageIgnoreSwipe to modifyDamage and changed arguments
- removed some redundant EnumTypes that are also in vanilla EnumEnchantmentType
- moved incompatible enchants to config, deleted all canApplyTogether overrides
- cleaned up incompatible enchant groups

## Renames
- WellTilled = Moisturized
- TillingPower = Plowing
- Sharper(ed) Edge = Reinforced Sharpness
- Pulling/Drag = Dragging
- Clear Skies' Favor = Clearskies' Favor
- Luna's Blessing = Lunar's Blessing

## Code cleanup by Enchant
- Pushing.repelEntitiesInAABBFromPoint math cleanup
  - capped denominators to avoid dividing by 0 or negative numbers
- Both Ancient enchants implement IAncient
- Adv Thorns and Burning Thorns search through the whole equipment, not just armor to do dura dmg
  - this is to allow them on shields for example or on any other equipment on main/offhand if wanted
- Burning Thorns properly does dura dmg now (was searching for an item that has Thorns, not burn thorns)
- Added IEnchantmentFire to move fireticks per level to enchant and be able to call that from arc slash
- Freezing code cleanup having 5 lines per block thats turned to ice and having lots of code to differentiate between players and non-players just to add one extra amplifier
- Cleaned up OtherHandler."enchHand", renamed to subjectHandler
- Flame Tier Types set to Bow (why was it Weapon=Sword?)
- Cleaned up TierDamage - only actual change is entitydamagedalt mistakingly checking 5 and 6 instead of 4 and 5 (both BoA's)
- Cleaned up Weather Enchants except for rain having an if bracket thats never called - unsure whether to fix and thus nerf it or to delete it
- Cleaned up CombatVeterancy code - seems op
- Cleaned up CounterAttack - mainly deleting commented out code and replaced 20 with maxhurtresistanttime
- fixed unreasonable always proccing (roll was wrong) and not stopping to go through entity list after one random target was found
- cleaned up rune magical blessing and fixed it only working (and crashing) if the player DOESNT have it

## Im too lazy so sort this later
- Refactored and simplified everything
- Buffed Sol/Luna blessing to not be effectively curses, gives buff in correct time, lesser buff if underground, no buff if incorrect time
- Reworked Rune Revival to be mixin to vastly simplify/fix handling
- Fixed bugs with evasion potion divide by 0 and hurt resistance timings
- Reworked magmawalker into mixin
- Reworked and fixed attribute handling of strengthened vitality and underwater strider
- Simplified strafe draw speed calculations
- Added fixes for curses handling from RLMixins
- Reworked rune enchants, magical/resurrection/revival should now work properly, resurrection is now a shield enchant
- Reworked and improved smelter
- Removed quarrying because it seemingly is only a dupe generator
- Add config option for making advanced mending prioritize damaged items
- Rework adept to give a boost to boss xp and compat for blights
- Fix advanced mending being applicable with infinity
- Rework ancient sealed curses to work better
- Rework and simplify ancient sword mastery with mixin, increases damage increase of damage increasing enchants by 25% per level
- Rework dark shadows to only be based on attacker's light level, and make blindness chance scaling
- Add cooled strength/low damage checks to enchants to prevent triggered from click spam
- merged advanced sharp/smite/arthro into EnchantmentTierDamage
- simplify and buff damage from Butchering
- improve defusing from DefusingEdge
- buff penetrating edge to scale better with more armor
- buff reinforced sharpness and remove iframe abuse glitch
- fix supreme smite missing extra effects
- heavily simplify water aspect
- Slightly buff LuckMagnification to bring it a little closer to CriticalStrike
- Critical Strike and Luck Magnification moved to their own incompat list since they affect crits and not base damage
- Add Hardcore mode buff to DifficultysEndowment
- First pass rebalance damagemult enchants, assuming max level:
- DifficultysEndowment: Hard 1.5x Hardcore 2x
- AshDestroyer: 2x when victim is on fire
- ReviledBlade: 1x - 3x depending on victim health, increasing with less health
- CursedEdge: 3x but self-damaging at 0.25x of dealt damage as magic
- Instability: 1x - 3.25x depending on item health, increasing with more item damage, still incompat with unbreaking, deals additional damage to item

## Todo
- Organize event handler priorities
- Split damage handling or spartan compat
- Handle removing enchants from Villagers and Loot enchanting
- More sound effects? (Like resurrection)
- Recheck that all offhand/rlcombat compat checks are working properly (Anything triggered from attackEntityFrom should only use mainhand now)
- Recheck anything that should be moved to using RLCombat events (To check for attack strength for effects from attacks, etc)
